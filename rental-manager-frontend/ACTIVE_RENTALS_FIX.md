# Active Rentals Menu Visibility Fix

## Issue
The "Active Rentals" menu item is not appearing in the Rentals submenu at https://www.omomrentals.shop/rentals/active

## Root Cause
The demo user authentication is failing in production, preventing proper menu rendering. The sidebar component checks user permissions before displaying menu items.

## Investigation Results

1. **Menu Configuration**: The Active Rentals menu item IS properly configured in `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   {
     id: 'active-rentals',
     label: 'Active Rentals',
     icon: 'FileText',
     path: '/rentals/active',
     permissions: ['RENTAL_VIEW'],
   }
   ```

2. **Authentication Issue**: The demo user (demo/demo123) is failing to authenticate in production with error "Username or Email"

3. **Permission Check**: The sidebar uses `hasItemPermission()` function that checks if user has required permissions. Without proper authentication, no rental menu items will show.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Fix Demo User Authentication (Recommended)
1. Check production database for demo user existence
2. Verify demo user has correct permissions
3. Ensure demo user is active

### Option 2: Create New Test User
1. Create a new user with proper RENTAL_VIEW permissions
2. Test with new credentials

### Option 3: Use Admin User
1. Use admin credentials for testing (if available)
2. Admin users bypass permission checks

## Temporary Workaround
Users can directly navigate to `/rentals/active` if they have proper permissions, even if the menu item doesn't appear.

## Code Locations
- Sidebar component: `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`
- Menu configuration: Lines 255-261
- Permission check: Lines 439-445
- Icon map: Lines 390-419 (Calendar icon was missing and has been added)

## Status
- ✅ Menu configuration is correct
- ✅ Calendar icon added to iconMap
- ❌ Demo user authentication failing in production
- ⏳ Need to fix authentication or create proper test user

## Next Steps
1. Check production database for user accounts
2. Verify/fix demo user or create new test user
3. Ensure user has RENTAL_VIEW permission
4. Test menu visibility after authentication fix
