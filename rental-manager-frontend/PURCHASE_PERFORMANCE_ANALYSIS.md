## Performance Metrics Analysis

### Test Results Summary (Mock API Demo)

| Operation | Total Ops | Success Rate | Avg Response Time | 95th Percentile | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| CREATE    | 1 (bulk)  | 100.0%       | 2,560.12ms       | 2,560.12ms      | ‚ö†Ô∏è High |
| READ      | 30        | 100.0%       | 51.18ms          | 51.51ms         | ‚úÖ Excellent |
| UPDATE    | 1 (bulk)  | 100.0%       | 1,050.95ms       | 1,050.95ms      | ‚ö†Ô∏è High |
| DELETE    | 1 (bulk)  | 100.0%       | 2,501.20ms       | 2,501.20ms      | ‚ö†Ô∏è High |

### Performance Characteristics

#### 1. READ Operations - Excellent Performance
- **Average Response Time:** 51.18ms
- **Consistency:** Low variance (50.49ms - 53.99ms range)
- **Throughput:** 19.51 operations/second
- **Assessment:** ‚úÖ Meets performance expectations

#### 2. Individual Operation Performance
- **CREATE Operations:** Individual purchases averaged 51.20ms
- **UPDATE Operations:** Individual updates averaged 52.55ms  
- **DELETE Operations:** Individual deletes averaged 51.04ms
- **Assessment:** ‚úÖ All individual operations perform well

#### 3. Bulk Operation Considerations
- **Observation:** Bulk operations show higher total times due to sequential processing
- **Recommendation:** Consider concurrent execution for production workloads
- **Note:** Mock API includes artificial 50ms delay per operation
