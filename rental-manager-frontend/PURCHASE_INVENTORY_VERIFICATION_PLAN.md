# Purchase-to-Inventory Impact Verification Plan

## üéØ Objective
Verify that creation of new purchase transactions with auto-complete functionality properly affects all inventory module tables (inventory_units, stock_levels, stock_movements).

---

## üìã Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Pre-Verification Analysis
**Goal**: Understand current state and validate implementation readiness

1. **Implementation Analysis**
   - ‚úÖ Confirm auto-complete purchase implementation is active
   - ‚úÖ Validate purchase service calls inventory service methods
   - ‚úÖ Verify database schema supports integration
   - ‚úÖ Check API endpoints are functional

2. **Environment Validation**
   - ‚úÖ Docker services running (database, API, frontend)
   - ‚úÖ Test data exists (suppliers, locations, items)
   - ‚úÖ Database connectivity confirmed
   - ‚úÖ API authentication working

### Phase 2: Baseline Establishment
**Goal**: Capture current inventory state for comparison

1. **Database State Capture**
   - Record current counts in inventory_units table
   - Record current counts in stock_levels table  
   - Record current counts in stock_movements table
   - Record current purchase transaction counts
   - Document existing test data IDs

2. **Test Data Validation**
   - Confirm supplier exists and is active
   - Confirm location exists and is active
   - Confirm items exist and are purchaseable
   - Validate foreign key relationships

### Phase 3: Purchase Transaction Execution
**Goal**: Create actual purchase transactions and monitor effects

1. **Single Item Purchase Test**
   - Create purchase with 1 item, quantity 3
   - Use auto_complete: true (default)
   - Monitor transaction creation success
   - Capture transaction ID for tracking

2. **Multi-Item Purchase Test**
   - Create purchase with 3 different items
   - Various quantities (1, 2, 5)
   - Test different batch codes
   - Monitor all transaction lines

3. **Purchase Status Verification**
   - Confirm purchase status is COMPLETED immediately
   - Verify purchase appears in transaction_headers
   - Check transaction_lines are created properly

### Phase 4: Inventory Impact Verification
**Goal**: Verify all inventory tables are updated correctly

1. **inventory_units Table Verification**
   - Confirm individual inventory units are created
   - Verify quantities match purchase quantities
   - Check unit costs are recorded correctly
   - Validate supplier linkage
   - Confirm batch codes/serial numbers
   - Verify purchase date and location

2. **stock_levels Table Verification**
   - Confirm stock quantities increased
   - Verify quantity_on_hand updated
   - Check quantity_available updated
   - Validate average cost calculations
   - Confirm location-specific stock levels

3. **stock_movements Table Verification**
   - Confirm purchase movement records created
   - Verify movement type is PURCHASE-related
   - Check quantity changes are positive
   - Validate before/after quantities
   - Confirm transaction linkage (foreign keys)
   - Verify audit trail completeness

### Phase 5: Integration Validation
**Goal**: Verify proper integration between purchase and inventory systems

1. **Transaction Linkage Verification**
   - Confirm stock_movements link to transaction_headers
   - Verify inventory_units reference purchase transaction
   - Check referential integrity maintained
   - Validate cascade relationships

2. **Business Logic Validation**
   - Verify purchase completion triggers inventory updates
   - Confirm inventory visibility through API
   - Check inventory search and filtering
   - Validate inventory reporting accuracy

3. **Data Consistency Verification**
   - Confirm inventory totals match purchase totals
   - Verify cost calculations are accurate
   - Check quantity reconciliation
   - Validate timestamp consistency

### Phase 6: Edge Case Testing
**Goal**: Test error conditions and edge cases

1. **Error Condition Tests**
   - Test with invalid supplier ID
   - Test with invalid location ID
   - Test with invalid item ID
   - Test with zero/negative quantities

2. **Boundary Tests**
   - Test with very large quantities
   - Test with very small unit prices
   - Test with maximum string lengths
   - Test with special characters in notes

3. **Rollback Tests**
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios
   - Verify inventory not updated on failures
   - Check partial failure handling
   - Validate database consistency

## üîß Technical Implementation Plan

### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure services are running
docker-compose up -d

# Verify database connectivity
docker exec rental_manager_postgres psql -U rental_user -d rental_db -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Test Data Requirements
```sql
-- Required test data
- Supplier ID: b128a522-2923-4535-98fa-0f04db881ab4
- Location ID: 70b8dc79-846b-47be-9450-507401a27494  
- Item IDs: bb2c8224-755d-4005-8868-b0683944364f, [additional items]
```

### Verification Queries
```sql
-- Baseline capture queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM inventory_units;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_levels;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stock_movements;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transaction_headers WHERE transaction_type = 'PURCHASE';

-- Post-purchase verification queries
SELECT * FROM inventory_units WHERE purchase_date::date = CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT * FROM stock_levels WHERE updated_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT * FROM stock_movements WHERE movement_type LIKE '%PURCHASE%' 
  AND created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;
```

### API Test Payloads
```json
{
  "supplier_id": "b128a522-2923-4535-98fa-0f04db881ab4",
  "location_id": "70b8dc79-846b-47be-9450-507401a27494",

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Solutions
1. **Database Connection Issues**: Verify Docker services, restart if needed
2. **API Authentication Errors**: Check endpoints, use direct database if needed
3. **Test Data Conflicts**: Use unique identifiers, clean up after tests
4. **Foreign Key Violations**: Verify test data exists before purchase creation
5. **Transaction Rollbacks**: Test in isolation, don't affect production data

### Backup Plans
- **API Fails**: Test service layer directly
- **Service Issues**: Verify database triggers/procedures
- **Data Conflicts**: Use separate test environment
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on critical success metrics first

This comprehensive plan will definitively verify whether purchase transactions properly affect inventory module tables with the new auto-complete functionality.
